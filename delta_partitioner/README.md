## DeltaPartitioner

DeltaPartitioner is a software version history partitioning tool for Java projects. It applies delta-debugging sytle partitioning algorithm to partition the set of commits in a selected range of software history, producing 1-minimal semantic history slice (a sub-sequence of a change history that preserves the functionality of interest, which is defined by a set of test cases).
